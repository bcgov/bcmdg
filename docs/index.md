# Mobile app development

The B.C. government provides many types of mobile apps to the public, like wildlife tracking and employment services. These apps are available for download on [Apple's App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/his-majesty-the-king-in-right-of-the/id487323275) and [Google's Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada&hl=en_CA&gl=US). We also create private apps used by employees for their job functions.

The Developer Experience team will assist you in your mobile app development journey. While we won't code, design or review your app, we'll help you:

* Onboard to the app stores
* Connect with other mobile dev teams
* Manage signing certificates

[Contact us](contact.md) to book an appointment at the start of your project. Find more information about what to expect at the meeting in our [Getting Started](getting_started.md) guide.
