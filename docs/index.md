# Mobile App Development

The Province of BC provides many types of mobile apps to the public. From wild life tracking, to digital ID, to employment services and more.  These apps are available for download on [Apple's App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/his-majesty-the-king-in-right-of-the/id487323275) and [Google's Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Province+of+British+Columbia,+Canada&hl=en_CA&gl=US). The Province also creates private apps used by its employees for their job functions.

The Developer Experience Team will assist you in your mobile app development journey. While we will not code, design or review your app, we will help you:

* onboard to the app stores
* connect with other mobile dev teams, where applicable
* manage signing certificates

Please book an appointment with us at: [Developer.Experience@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Developer.Experience@gov.bc.ca) at the start of your project. Find more information about what to expect at the meeting in our [Getting Started](initiate.md) guide.
