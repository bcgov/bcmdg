# Mobile app distribution methods

Mobile apps are distributed through the public app stores or MDM InTune. Your distribution method is determined by who will use your app.

![Diagram of the various distribution methods. If the app is for the general public, it's distributed via the Apple App Store and Google Play Stores. If it's an app for Government employees, it's distributed via MDM inTunes. If it's an app for Employees and Contractors it is distributed as an unlisted app via the Apple App Store.](assets/distribution.drawio.svg)

## Public apps
Public apps are released through the Province's accounts on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. 

You must list your app through the Province's accounts. The [Developer Experience team](contact.md) helps you get your app on these accounts.

Before contacting the Developer Experience team, we recommend reviewing the [project initiation information](getting_started.md).

Once setup is complete, you'll have access to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) and [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/about/) to manage your app.

## Internal apps
Employee apps are distributed through [MDM inTune by the OCIO Device Management Team](https://citz.sp.gov.bc.ca/sites/ES/DS/MDAS/Docs/SitePages/Home.aspx). While historically, employee apps only supported iOS devices, they're now also supported by Android. If you're planning to create an internal Android app, [contact us](contact.md). 

[Contact us](contact.md) at the start of your project so we can discuss the process for distributing an internal app. It requires setup from both the Developer Experience and OCIO Device Management teams.

Apps used by both employees and contractors also need extra setup in Apple's App Store Connect. The [Developer Experience Team](contact.md) will assist in this setup.

## App review process
Both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store have an app review process. 

When creating your app, it's important to consider how the app reviewer will interact with your app. For example, if your app requires a user to login, the app reviewer will need either an account or access to a demo account. 

If you believe your internal app can't go through the app review process, contact the [Developer Experience team](contact.md) for guidance.

Consult the [Apple app guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/) and [Google app guidelines](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859455?hl=en&ref_topic=7072031&sjid=10634496881788336983-NA) when preparing your app's release. It's important to follow their guidelines to ensure a smooth review process.



## Beta testing distribution

An app can be distributed for beta testing before its official release. 

Apple offers [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) and Google offers [open, closed and internal testing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9845334?_ga=2.46417955.584331364.1687196439-22968901.1675209271&_gac=1.16068354.1687196439.EAIaIQobChMImu70vvDP_wIV4w6tBh0qkAu2EAAYASAAEgIVwvD_BwE). Both platforms allow you to invite testers to try out your app on their devices before its official release. This provides an opportunity to gather feedback and make improvements before the public launch.
